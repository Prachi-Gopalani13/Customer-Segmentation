路 Price                                                                                                                                                                             
路 and Quantity columns in this Analysis                                                                                                                                             

Step 1: Month Extraction from InvoiceDate Column
Step 2: Assigning Cohorts to Each Column
Step 3: Assigning Cohort Index to each transaction
Step 4: Calculating number of unique customers in each Group of (CohortDate,Index)
